# R Markdown HTML Documentation Example README

This is an example of a 'single page' project document that I have designed for every day use for cleaning, processing, and analyzing data in R. 

To view the user-friendly final product, you will want to download the .html file and open it. It will open like a website in your web browser (e.g.., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). It will not open and display correctly if you simply click on the file on github. 

The main R Markdown file is the same name as the final product, and is the main file to edit code and content for the final .html document. The current example is a truncated cleaning document I have previously generated to clean MIDUS data, which is a publicly available dataset. 

In this folder, I have included most of the files needed to create the final product, including 'child' documents that can be edited and reused in multiple final documents, so that edits related to overall projects, datasets, etc. can be made in one place instead of updating every document individually. The custom CSS and .html template files that that dictate what the final .html page looks like and how it functions are not currently included in this repository.

I have additional templates for 'multi-page' projects and other examples that will be added here as my time permits.
